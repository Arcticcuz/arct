A backup of a very, very simple tool I made for learning Swedish. It simply reads a wordlist in the format word1:word2 (each pair on its own 
line)  and 
checks 
whether 
they're equal. Wordlist is the first argument when launching the program. Wordlist is loaded in to a slice, and when you get the word right, it 
is removed from the slice. The order it asks the words in is pseudo-random.  Not worth using!
