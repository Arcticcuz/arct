A backup of a very, very simple tool I made for learning Swedish. It simply reads a wordlist in the format word1:word2 and checks whether 
they're equal. Wordlist is the first argument when launching the program. Wordlist is loaded in to a slice, and when you get the word right, it 
is removed from the slice. Not worth using!
